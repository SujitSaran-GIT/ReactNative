Components
---------------
Components are independent * reuseable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JS functions but work in isolation and return HTML

JSX
------------
JSX allows us to write HTML in React Native. JSX makes it easier to write & add HTML in React

Expression In JSX
---------------------
With JSX you can write expression inside curly braces. The expressions can be a variable, or property, or any other valid Javascript expression. JSX will execute the expression and return the result

FlatList
------------
FlatList will iterate all over the data and render the list of the data

Props
-----------------
Props / Properties are arguments passed into Components
Props are passed to components via HTML attributes

Conditional Rendering 
-------------------------
Conditional Rendering in React Native works the same way as conditional works in JavaScript. You can use JavaScrpt operators like if & or Ternary to represent the current state and let React Native update the UI to match them
